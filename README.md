# Turing

## Overview

A pure go implementation of the Turing stream cipher, as detailed in
"Turing: a Fast Stream Cipher" by Gregory G. Rose and Philip Hawkes.
Please don't use this cipher if your goal is to implement strong encryption.
This package was written to interoperate with legacy applications.

## API Promise

The API is stable.  Changes are guaranteed to remain backwards-compatible.

## Usage

Please see the [godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/ziuchkovski/turing) for usage details.
